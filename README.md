# Lease-Abstraction-using-NER-Model
This NER Training Model recognizes named entities and abstract lease information automatically to reduce man power and manual errors.
This Model is trained using deep learning algorithms by passing the training model into neural network layers for multiple epochs and iterations model is trained until loss function value is reduced and the difference between actual or targeted output and predicted output value are matched.
